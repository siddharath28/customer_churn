📊 Customer Churn Analysis Using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using supervised machine learning techniques. Churn analysis helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave their services, enabling them to take proactive measures to retain them. The dataset used contains various customer attributes such as demographics, services subscribed, and account information.

🎯 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns.

Engineer meaningful features to enhance model performance.

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

Identify the most influential factors contributing to customer churn.

Provide actionable insights for business strategy.
